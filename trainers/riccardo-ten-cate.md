# Riccardo ten Cate

As a penetration tester from the Netherlands Riccardo ten Cate specializes in application security and has extensive knowledge in securing applications in multiple coding languages. Riccardo has many years of experience in training and guiding development teams becoming more mature and making their applications secure by design. Not only does Riccardo train developers, he and his brother Glenn also donated an entire knowledge framework solely dedicated to help developers make their code secure by design to OWASP. See: [SKF \(Security knowledge framework\)](https://www.securityknowledgeframework.org/). 

Riccardo also has expertise on implementing security test automation in CI/CD pipelines. This helps create short feedback loops back to the developer and prevents bugs from getting into production in an early phase of the development lifecycle.
