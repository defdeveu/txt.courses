title: **Docker security**

audience: XOX

duration: 1 days \(6hrs education time\)

developed by: Riccardo ten Cate

### Prerequisites

XOX

## Agenda

#### Docker security fundamentals

* This topic will talk about the Docker security fundamentals such as using minimalistic images, principle of least privilege etc.

#### Docker vulnerability scanning

* How do we scan our docker images for security continuously even before we deploy them to production? What are the best practices for vulnerability scanning on Docker images.

#### Docker scratch images

* Using minimalistic images is a nice way to get starting. However, for very critical infrastructure

  we may want to build our own images from scratch.

#### Using a keyvault to protect your secrets

* By deploying applications through Docker it becomes more important than ever to handle your secrets correctly. Are all your secrets in one place? are they not checked in into version control? Are they laying around in your CI tools?

#### Docker hacking

* Let's play this hands-on CTF game where we effectively need to break out of a Docker container and take over the host machine.
