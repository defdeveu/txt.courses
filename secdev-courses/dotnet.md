## About the course

### Properties

`title` **Secure development in .net/C\#**

`revision` R1811i %wip

`audience` senior/medior developers, lead devs, testers and security champions \(mostly comprehensible for juniors as well\)

`duration` 2 days \(12 hrs education time\) in the standard case

`options` DIY code and ASVS audit; [assisted code-review lab](../modules/codereview-lab.md); [S-SDLC playbook](../modules/ssdlc-playbook.md)

`already delivered to` Logmein, Siemens, AEGON

With the Secure development in .net/C\# course we deliver a complete set of knowledge and practicing. We can on the fly flex the course to meet the level and the experiences of the audience.

### Prerequisites

We assume that the developers attending the C\# secdev course:

* are familiar with the C\# language and with the .NET framework
* understand the HTTP protocol, HTML and Javascript
* are familiar with basic security features of an enterprise application \(authentication, authorization, the concept of a session\)
* have .net core 2.0 SDK and a suitable IDE installed on their laptop \(labs desktop\)

### Agenda ingredients

{% hint style="info" %}
The below agenda represents a collection of topics and classes we deliver on a course, normally or optionally, in depth or in a short version depending on the needs of the client and the actual audience. The below agenda does not represent a lineup of the topics and classes.
{% endhint %}

For many of the topics in the below agenda we prepare demos, code fixing exercises, and DIY practices. Most of the hands-ons and other practical exercises are available as cloud instances developed and hosted by defdev.eu.

A defdev course for developers consists of the following ingredients:

* [Intros](../delivery/agenda-ingredients.md#intros) \[see block A\]; 
* [Secure coding](../delivery/agenda-ingredients.md#secure-coding) \[see block B\]; 
* [Secure architecting](../delivery/agenda-ingredients.md#secure-architecting) \[see block C\]; 
* [Framework/language specifics](../delivery/agenda-ingredients.md#framework-language-specifics) \[see [block D](java.md#secure-coding-in-java-jee)\]; 
* [Security testing and audit](../delivery/agenda-ingredients.md#security-testing-and-audit) \[see [block E](../modules/codereview-lab.md)\]; 
* [Options](../delivery/agenda-ingredients.md#options)

### Course variants

By default the duration of a course is 2 days, 12 hours education time in the standard case. But it also can take 3 days depending on the demands, the preferences regarding the coverage or the depth and also the options requested. The general content variants are:

* [2 days, broad coverage](../delivery/course-variants.md#2-days-broad-coverage)
* [2 days, in-depth selected topics](../delivery/course-variants.md#2-days-in-depth-selected-topics) 
* [3 days, both depth and scope ](../delivery/course-variants.md#3-days-both-depth-and-scope)
* [3 days, assisted code-review](../delivery/course-variants.md#3-days-assisted-code-review)

{% hint style="info" %}
Developed by Riccardo ten Cate
{% endhint %}

* Security features of .NET and what kind of protection they serve
* C\# language security \(is C\# a secure language?\) 
* .NET-specific issues 
  * Numeric overflow, automatic conversions
  * Serialization
  * Authentication, membership, provider model
  * Login controls, session management
  * Role based authorization
  * ViewState
  * Identity server
  * OAuth
* Cryptography in .NET
  * How to use a key vault
  * How to test entropy of secure random solutions

#### JS frameworks _\[optional\]_

* Angular JS/TS
* Polymer
* React

#### HTML5 _\[optional\]_

* Local storage/session storage 
* Web messaging, web sockets

### E. Security testing and audit

Practicing is part of many of the above blocks. We start off basic hacking challenges, but the real exercises are about fixing vulnerable codes, and tasks when attendees need to assess code and an application on their own. We mostly offer cloud based facilities to run the exercise environments, so no local installation is needed.

#### Hands-ons with vulnerable apps

* For most of the courses there are intentionally vulnerable applications which we use to demonstrate and learn specific vulnerabilities and how to fix them.
* In some cases we use public "damn vulnerable" applications, in some cases we prepared our own applications to practice with. 

#### DIY sonarqube code checking

* We assume that developers should be capable of running basic automated tests against the security of their codes on their own. And also be able to tune the SCA tools to produce reasonable false positive and valuable findings ratio. 
* Normally we teach how to use security plugins of Sonarqube. 
* We provide sample codes to test. Though the best experience is achieved when developers run the security SCA against their own codes. 
* See also the extra, on-demand block of 'Assisted code-review lab' below for practicing on your own codes. 

#### DIY ASVS self-audit

* OWASP ASVS is the current standard for assessing the security quality and design flaws of a \(web\) application, and it's the developers who know the answers to the ASVS audit questions. So we take developers to a short journey in assessing the security properties of their applications.

### Extras _\[optional\]_

Upon request we also deliver additional blocks:

* K: In case of languages and frameworks our trainers are familiar with as auditors we can deliver an additional day to let developers apply the knowledge and skills learnt against their own codes. We call it the 'Assisted code-review lab'. 
* L-N: We also suggest one of the related add-on courses: S-SDLC playbook Hacking applications Security test automation in CI/CD pipelines
