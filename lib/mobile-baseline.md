# Mobile security baseline

## About the course

The course provides a solid overview about how mobile applications can be viewed from a hacker's perspective. Besides introducing the audience to concepts and ideas, the participants are also provided with examples and demo applications for common hacking tools, exploiting security pitfalls, design and implementation mistakes.

### Properties

title: **Mobile security baseline**

aka: "Secure coding and design principles for mobile**"**
