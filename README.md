defdev secure development trainings are designed to **significantly improve the security quality of the software production** by mastering secure coding skills and through adopting sticky development practices that systematically reduce defects.

We do trainings on Java, Js/React/Angular, Node.js, iOS/Android, C\#, Golang, Python, Kotlin and PHP secure coding, IoT and mainframe security, also S-SDLC \(secdev playbook\) and CI/CD pipeline \(security testing automation and vulnerability management\).
