# README

{% hint style="warning" %}
The defdeveu courses catalog is a work in progress
{% endhint %}

defdev secure development trainings are designed to **significantly improve the security quality of the software production** by mastering secure coding skills and through adopting sticky development practices that systematically reduce defects.

## Secdev courses

Our **secure development** courses are mostly structured around the [`OWASP ASVS`](https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS), and are based on cloud-hosted exercises and many DIY tasks.

We flex the actual delivery according to the audience on the fly, in terms of the depth of different topics in agenda.

We offer the following standard secdev _\*\*_courses which are flexible to be customized. Also check out the extra addons in the next section which can greatly expand the impact of the course.
