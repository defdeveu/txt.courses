defdev secure development trainings are designed to **significantly improve the security quality of the software production** by mastering secure coding skills and through adopting sticky development practices that systematically reduce defects.

## Secdev courses

Our **secure development** courses are mostly structured around the [`OWASP ASVS`](https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS), and are based on cloud-hosted exercises and many DIY tasks.

We flex the actual delivery according to the audience on the fly, in terms of the depth of different topics in agenda.

We offer the following standard secdev courses which are flexible to be customized. Also check out the extra addons in the next section which can greatly expand the impact of the course.

* [Webapp development with security in mind](secdev-courses/webapp-secure-development.md)
* [Secure development in Java/JEE](secdev-courses/secure-development-in-java.md)
* [Secure development in .net/C\#](secdev-courses/secure-development-in-.net.md)
* [Secure development for Android](secdev-courses/secure-development-for-android.md)
* [Secure development for iOS](secdev-courses/secure-development-for-ios.md)
* [Secure development in C/C++](secdev-courses/secure-development-in-cpp.md)
* [Secure development in Javascript](modules/language-specific-modules/js-specific.md)

We also offer secdev courses in Kotlin, Python, Node.js and PHP. Please check back later. Subscribe to our twitter @[defdeveu](https://twitter.com/defdeveu) for updates and announcements.
