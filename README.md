# README

defdev secure development trainings are designed to **significantly improve the security quality of the software production** by mastering secure coding skills and through adopting sticky development practices that systematically reduce defects.

## Courses

**The European defensive development** \(defdev.eu\) project provides public and private \(and hybrid, aka hosted\) trainings for software development companies. We do **secure development**, security **testing** courses and trainings to establish secure **devops** and **SDLC** processes. 

### Secdev courses

We offer the following standard **secure development** courses:

* [Webapp development with security in mind](secdev-courses/webapp-secure-development.md)
* [Secure development in Java/JEE](secdev-courses/secure-development-in-java.md)
* [Secure development in .net/C\#](secdev-courses/secure-development-in-.net.md)
* [Secure development for Android](secdev-courses/secure-development-for-android.md)
* [Secure development for iOS](secdev-courses/secure-development-for-ios.md)
* [Secure development in C/C++](secdev-courses/secure-development-in-cpp.md)
* [Secure development in Javascript](modules/language-specific-modules/js-specific.md)

We also offer secdev courses in Kotlin, Python, Node.js and PHP. Please check back later. Subscribe to our twitter @[defdeveu](https://twitter.com/defdeveu) for updates and announcements.

Our secdev courses are mostly structured around the [`OWASP ASVS`](https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS) \(or MASVS\), and we promote CMU/SEI guidelines where possible.

Also check out the extra addons in a below section which can greatly expand the **impact** of the course.

### Testing courses

* [Security test automation in CI/CD pipelines](testing-courses/security-test-automation-in-ci-cd-pipelines.md)
* [Burp for developers](testing-courses/burp.md)

### DevSecOps courses

* [Docker security](devsecops-courses/docker-security.md)
* [AWS security](devsecops-courses/aws-security.md)

### Extras/addons

* [Assisted code-review lab](modules/assisted-code-review-lab.md)
* [S-SDLC playbook](modules/s-sdlc-playbook.md)
* [Hacking applications](modules/hacking-applications.md)

## Delivery

The lectures are mixed with cloud-hosted exercises and many DIY tasks, we also use gamification approach in education. We flex the actual delivery according to the audience on the fly, adapting the scope and the depth of different topics indicated in the course agendas. Read more about our practices and approach:

* [Main features of our trainings](delivery/main-features.md)
* [Agenda ingredients](delivery/agenda-ingredients.md)
* [Course variants](delivery/course-variants.md)
* [Delivery variants](delivery/delivery-variants.md)

Our **trainers** are practitioners with authority and have years of experience in enterprise software production: such as security testers who are good at coding or senior developers who learnt security testing and S-SDLC.
