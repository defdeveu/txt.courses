defdev secure development trainings are designed to **significantly improve the security quality of the software production** by mastering secure coding skills and through adopting sticky development practices that systematically reduce defects.

We do trainings on Java, Js/React/Angular, Node.js, iOS/Android, C\#, Golang, Python, Kotlin and PHP secure coding, IoT and mainframe security, also S-SDLC \(secdev playbook\) and CI/CD pipeline \(security testing automation and vulnerability management\). Our courses are mostly structured around the OWASP ASVS, and are based on cloud-hosted exercises and DIY tasks.

## Secdev courses

We offer the following standard **secure development** courses which are flexible to be customized, and we flex the actual delivery according to the audience on the fly. Also check out the extra addons in the next section which can greatly expand the impact of the course.
